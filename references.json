    "abstract": "  Knowledge Graphs (KG) and associated Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models have recently begun to be explored in the context of drug discovery and have the potential to assist in key challenges such as target identification. In the drug discovery domain, KGs can be employed as part of a process which can result in lab-based experiments being performed, or impact on other decisions, incurring significant time and financial costs and most importantly, ultimately influencing patient healthcare. For KGE models to have impact in this domain, a better understanding of not only of performance, but also the various factors which determine it, is required.\n  In this study we investigate, over the course of many thousands of experiments, the predictive performance of five KGE models on two public drug discovery-oriented KGs. Our goal is not to focus on the best overall model or configuration, instead we take a deeper look at how performance can be affected by changes in the training setup, choice of hyperparameters, model parameter initialisation seed and different splits of the datasets. Our results highlight that these factors have significant impact on performance and can even affect the ranking of models. Indeed these factors should be reported along with model architectures to ensure complete reproducibility and fair comparisons of future work, and we argue this is critical for the acceptance of use, and impact of KGEs in a biomedical setting. To aid reproducibility of our own work, we release all experimentation code. ",

    "abstract": "Incorrect drug target identification is a major obstacle in drug discovery. Only 15% of drugs advance from Phase II to approval, with ineffective targets accounting for over 50% of these failures . Advances in data fusion and computational modeling have independently progressed towards addressing this issue. Here, we capitalize on both these approaches with Rosalind, a comprehensive gene prioritization method that combines heterogeneous knowledge graph construction with relational inference via tensor factorization to accurately predict disease-gene links. Rosalind demonstrates an increase in performance of 18%-50% over five comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. On historical data, Rosalind prospectively identifies 1 in 4 therapeutic relationships eventually proven true. Beyond efficacy, Rosalind is able to accurately predict clinical trial successes (75% recall at rank 200) and distinguish likely failures (74% recall at rank 200). Lastly, Rosalind predictions were experimentally tested in a patient-derived assay for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which yielded 5 promising genes, one of which is unexplored in RA.",

    "abstract": "Hetionet v1.0 is a hetnet (heterogeneous network) with 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. This record contains computed connectivity measurements for Hetionet v1.0 for all metapaths (types of paths) up to length 3. These measurements are designed to assess the extent of connectivity between two nodes along a given metapath. Several types of data are included: <strong>Path counts</strong>: Path counts measure the number of paths from a source node to a target node along a specified metapath. The path count is a special case of the degree-weighted path count (DWPC) metric where the damping exponent parameter is set to 0.0. Path counts for all source–target node combinations of a given metapath are stored in a matrix with source nodes as rows and target nodes as columns. <strong>Degree-weighted path counts</strong>: DWPCs measure the abundance of paths from a source to target node along a given metapath (like path counts), but are adjusted for the degrees along the path such that paths through higher degree nodes are downweighted according to a damping parameter. The DWPCs here use a damping exponent of 0.5 and the same matrix serialization as the path count datasets. The values are not scaled/transformed. To compare to the null DWPCs discussed below, divide each value by the mean DWPC for the entire matrix and apply an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation. <strong>Degree-grouped permutation summaries</strong>: Degree-grouped permutations (DGP) are used to compute the significance of DWPC values. Specifically, they are used to estimate null distribution for DWPCs from the unpermuted hetnet. DGP summaries provide summary statistics of DWPCs computed on permuted hetnets. The permuted hetnets are derived from Hetionet v1.0 using the XSwap algorithm. This approach preserves node degree but randomizes edges to muddle their meaning. DWPCs were computed for 200 permuted networks and grouped by source–target node degree within each metapath. Permuted DWPCs were scaled by dividing by the unpermuted DWPC mean and then inverse hyperbolic sine transformed. Every degree pair for a given metapath has corresponding statistics that summarize its values across permuted hetnets. These statistics include the number of observed DWPCs, the number of nonzero DWPCs, the sum of the DWPCs, and the sum of squared DWPCs. These values are sufficient to calculate the parameters of a gamma-hurdle null DWPC distribution. <strong>Data Format</strong>: the .zip files are HetMat archive files. This simply means that the directory structure and file formats of the archived files conform to the HetMat data structure for storing hetnets on disk. Matrices are stored as scipy.sparse .npz files. .npz is a numpy array serialization format that scipy uses to write sparse matrices to disk. TSV files in this upload report information on the contents of the archives. The .zip-info.tsv files contain a list of all files included in the zip archives. metapath-dwpc-stats.tsv contains summary information on the unpermuted path counts and DWPCs. Note that results are archived by path length, such that all metapaths of length 1 are in a different archive than metapaths of length 2. Therefore, users who only need results for shorter metapaths, do not need to download the large archives for longer metapaths. There are 24 metapaths of length 1, 242 metapaths of length 2, and 1939 metapaths of length 3. <strong>Connectivity Search Database</strong>: connectivity-search-pg_dump.sql.gz is a PostgreSQL database dump for use with the connectivity-search-backend repository. <strong>Source code</strong>: These datasets were computed by the bulk.ipynb notebook from greenelab/hetmech@34e95b9. <strong>Funding</strong>: This work was supported through a research collaboration with Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development. This work is funded in part by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation’s Data-Driven Discovery Initiative through Grants GBMF4552 and GBMF4560. <strong>More information</strong>: See the manuscript titled Hetnet connectivity search provides rapid insights into how two biomedical entities are related.",

    "abstract": "The ability to computationally predict whether a compound treats a disease would improve the economy and success rate of drug approval. This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.",

While each of them addresses specific needs, we report on a  community effort to a re-design and re-implementation of  PyKEEN, one of the early KGE libraries.  PyKEEN 1.0 enables users to compose knowledge graph embedding models based on a wide range of interaction models, training approaches, loss functions, and permits the explicit modeling of inverse relations. It allows users to measure each component's influence individually on the model's performance. Besides, an automatic memory optimization has been realized in order to optimally exploit the provided hardware. Through the integration of Optuna, extensive hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) functionalities are provided.",
